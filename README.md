# üß≠ Project Outline: Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

---

## 1. üí†  Introduction
- **Objective**: Segment customers of a UK-based online retail company using K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior.
- **Dataset Overview**: Transactional data from the Online Retail II dataset (UCI ID: 502), covering sales from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011, with attributes including InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
- **Goal**: Group customers into meaningful segments to inform targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention.


## 2. üìä Data Understanding
- **Data Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Online Retail II, ID: 502, CC BY 4.0 license).
- **Variables:**
  - InvoiceNo: 6-digit transaction ID (cancellations start with 'C').
  - StockCode: 5-digit product code.
  - Description: Product name.
  - Quantity: Items per transaction.
  - InvoiceDate: Transaction date and time.
  - UnitPrice: Price per item.
  - CustomerID: Unique customer identifier.
  - Country: Customer‚Äôs country.
- **Initial Exploration:**
  - Assess missing values (e.g., CustomerID, Description).
  - Aggregated metrics per customer:
  - Verify data types (e.g., InvoiceDate as datetime).
  - Summarize key metrics (e.g., transaction count, Quantity, UnitPrice).
    

## 3. üßπ Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Remove or impute missing CustomerID records.
  - Filter out cancellations (InvoiceNo starting with 'C').
  - Address negative quantities or prices, if invalid.
  - Standardize Description for consistency.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Calculate RFM metrics:
    - Recency: Days since last purchase.
    - Frequency: Number of transactions per customer.
    - Monetary: Total spending (Quantity * UnitPrice).
  - Derive additional features (e.g., average order value, purchase diversity).
  - Aggregate data at the CustomerID level for clustering.
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Normalize/scale RFM features for K-Means clustering.
  - Handle outliers (e.g., cap extreme values in Monetary or Frequency).


## 4. üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- RFM Analysis:
  - Analyze distributions of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
  - Identify high-value customers and inactive customers.
- Customer Behavior:
  - Explore purchase patterns by country.
  - Examine transaction frequency and spending trends.
- Visualization:
  - Histograms/box plots for RFM metrics.
  - Scatter plots to visualize relationships between RFM variables.
  - Bar charts for country-wise customer distribution.



## 5. üß† Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
- **Model Development:**
  - Apply K-Means clustering on RFM features.
  - Determine optimal number of clusters using:
    - Elbow method (plotting inertia vs. k).
    - Silhouette score for cluster cohesion.
  - Test different k values (e.g., 3‚Äì10 clusters).
- **Feature Selection:**
  - Use RFM metrics as primary features.
  - Optionally include derived features (e.g., average order value, country).
- **Implementation:**
  - Use scikit-learn‚Äôs KMeans module in Python.
  - Standardize features using StandardScaler.
  - Handle initialization sensitivity (e.g., multiple random starts).



## 6. üìè Model Evaluation
- **Cluster Quality:**
  - Evaluate using silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares.
  - Visualize clusters in 2D/3D scatter plots (e.g., Recency vs. Monetary).
- **Interpretability:**
  - Profile each cluster (e.g., ‚Äúhigh-value frequent buyers,‚Äù ‚Äúinactive low-spenders‚Äù).
  - Compare cluster characteristics (e.g., average RFM values, country distribution).
- **Validation:**
  - Test cluster stability with different random seeds.
  - Validate business relevance with domain knowledge (e.g., actionable segments).



## 7. üõ†Ô∏è  Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python.
- Libraries:
  - Data manipulation: pandas, numpy.
  - Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.
  - Clustering: scikit-learn.
- Data Access:
  - Fetch dataset using ```ucimlrepo```:
 
```python
  from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo
  online_retail_ii = fetch_ucirepo(id=502)
  data = online_retail_ii.data.features
```



## 8. üìù  Reporting and Visualization
- Dashboard:
  - Create an interactive dashboard (e.g., Plotly Dash) to display cluster profiles, RFM distributions, and customer counts.
- Report:
  - Summarize cluster characteristics and their business implications.
  - Provide recommendations for targeting each segment (e.g., loyalty programs for high-value customers).
- Visualizations:
  - Cluster scatter plots (e.g., Recency vs. Monetary).
  - Bar charts for cluster sizes and average RFM values.
  - Heatmaps for cross-cluster comparisons.


## 9.  üìå  Conclusion and Recommendations

### Key Findings:
  - Summarize identified customer segments (e.g., high-value, frequent, inactive).
  - Highlight differences in purchasing behavior across clusters.
### Business Recommendations:
  - Develop targeted marketing strategies (e.g., discounts for inactive customers, premium offers for high-value segments).
  - Optimize resource allocation based on segment profitability.
### Future Work:
  - Incorporate additional features (e.g., product categories) for refined segmentation.
  - Explore alternative clustering methods (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering).
